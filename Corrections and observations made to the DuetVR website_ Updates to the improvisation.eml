4. AR Photo Frame - video was missing now it's added - completed

*Only the following items need to be altered:*

vendors' video is available but can they add them on our website?
2. Hologram projection - completed but the footage quality is not upto the
mark (video is shaking)
3. 360 VR Photography - video needs to be uploaded - can we add other
vendors' video?
4. VR Soulmate for a special person - video needs to be uploaded - can we
add other vendors' video?
5. AR Wedding Album - video needs to be uploaded - can we add other
vendors' video?
6. AR Photobooth service - video needs to be uploaded - can we add other

*Please let me know if you are concerned and confirm whether we can put
videos of other vendors or share our video created for each card to add in
our site.  *
